#### "Cannot connect to .\SQLEXPRESS"  Cannot open user default database. Login failed.

I've deleted my database and suddenly was unable to login as the deleted one was the default database for the login. I panicked for a while, but it was easy to fix, actually. Click on Options and change the database from Default to master
